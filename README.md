# 30 Days of Solving Data Structures & Algorithms Problems

Welcome to the 30 Days of DSA Challenge! ðŸš€ This month-long coding journey is designed to enhance your Data Structures and Algorithms skills. In the course of this challenge we would improve our problem solving, critical thinking and collaboration skills. The problems to be solved would be taken from leetcode.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository:
   - Click the "Fork" button to create your copy.

2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/30DaysOfDSAChallenge.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
4. Solve the daily challenges:
   - Navigate to the respective day's folder.
   - Create a folder named as your Github username.
   - Navigate to your folder and solve the provided DSA problem.
   - Create a README file that contains a description of the problem you solved.
5. Commit and push changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Solved Day X Challenge"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
6. Create a Pull Request:
   - Submit your solutions by creating a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

## Guidelines

- There would be a minimum of one problem to solve per day.
- Follow the submission process outlined above.
- Ensure you submit your code on Leetcode before pushing to GitHub, also attach a link of your submission on Leetcode to your README file.
- You can use any programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, C++).
- Ensure your commit messages are meaningful.
- Your file names should also be meaningful, it could be the name of the solved problem.
- To view the problem for the day, always do a git pull in your terminal before you start working.
  ```
  git pull
  ```
- Always read the README file regularly.

## Collaboration and Discussion

- Encourage Collaboration: This challenge is not just about solving problems individually but also about collaboration and learning from each other. Feel free to collaborate with fellow participants.

- Share Solutions: Share your solutions in the discussion forum on Whatsapp. Discuss your approach, share insights, and help others understand your thought process.

- Discuss Approaches: Engage in discussions about different approaches to solving problems. Learn from the diverse perspectives of participants using various programming languages.

- Help Each Other: Be supportive and offer help to fellow participants. If you see an interesting approach or have suggestions for improvement, share your thoughts.
